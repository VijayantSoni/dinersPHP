			<p>We are team of skilled individuals trying to cope up with a very common problem in university as big as a little state. What we see is that it is quite a big problem everyone is facing right now in univeristies about availablility of food. Crowd in such institutions makes it even hard to even imagine a chance to have something to eat. We identified that the problem is just one channel available to get food. So here we are with a solution. We have created another channel to help you order your food using our platform and get your food served at the time you want. All we wish is for you all to have comfort and smile while you eat. We are trying our best to keep our services upto your satisfaction and are available for any remarks.</p>
			<p>Thank you</p>
